Since we are interested in the fiscal year 2018, we need to identify the correct figure for that year. \n\nGiven the context, it is reasonable to assume that the numbers are listed in reverse chronological order, with the first number representing the most recent fiscal year (2018), the second number representing the previous fiscal year (2017), and the third number representing the year before that (2016).\n\nTherefore, the capital expenditure amount for 3M in FY2018 is:\n\n**$1,577 million USD**\n\nThis conclusion is based on the assumption that the numbers are listed in reverse chronological order. If there is any doubt or need for further verification, it would be advisable to consult the full cash flow statement for 3M for FY2018.",

            "answer": "To determine if 3M is a capital-intensive business based on FY2022 data, we need to analyze several key financial metrics. Here is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. **Total Capital Expenditures (CapEx) for FY2022:**\n   - Purchases of property, plant, and equipment (PP&E) for 2022: $1,749 million.\n\n2. **Total Revenue for FY2022:**\n   - Total net sales for 2022: $34,229 million.\n\n3. **Total Assets for FY2022:**\n   - The document does not provide the total assets directly, but it does provide information on property, plant, and equipment (PP&E) net of accumulated depreciation:\n     - Property, plant, and equipment net: $9,178 million.\n\n4. **Significant Investments in Property, Plant, and Equipment:**\n   - The company invested $1,749 million in PP&E in 2022, which is a significant amount.\n\n5. **Comparisons of CapEx to Depreciation and Amortization:**\n   - Depreciation and amortization for 2022: $1,831 million.\n   - CapEx for 2022: $1,749 million.\n   - The CapEx is slightly lower than the depreciation and amortization, indicating that the company is reinvesting a substantial amount back into its capital assets.\n\n6. **Industry Benchmarks for Capital Intensity:**\n   - Industry benchmarks are not provided in the document, so we will focus on the available data.\n\n### Calculations:\n\n1. **CapEx as a Percentage of Revenue:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{CapEx to Revenue Ratio} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{CapEx}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100 = \\left( \\frac{1,749}{34,229} \\right) \\times 100 \\approx 5.11\\%\n   \\]\n\n2. **CapEx as a Percentage of Net PP&E:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{CapEx to Net PP&E Ratio} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{CapEx}}{\\text{Net PP&E}} \\right) \\times 100 = \\left( \\frac{1,749}{9,178} \\right) \\times 100 \\approx 19.06\\%\n   \\]\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- **CapEx to Revenue Ratio (5.11%)**: This indicates that 3M spends a moderate portion of its revenue on capital expenditures. A higher percentage would typically indicate a more capital-intensive business.\n- **CapEx to Net PP&E Ratio (19.06%)**: This shows that a significant portion of the net PP&E value is being reinvested annually, which is indicative of a capital-intensive business.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nBased on the provided data, 3M appears to be moderately capital-intensive. The company invests a significant amount in property, plant, and equipment relative to its revenue and net PP&E. However, without industry benchmarks, it is challenging to definitively classify the level of capital intensity. Nonetheless, the substantial investments in PP&E and the comparison to depreciation and amortization suggest that maintaining and growing its capital base is a significant aspect of 3M's operations.",

This was primarily due to:\n     - Special item costs for significant litigation related to PFAS matters.\n     - Higher raw materials and logistics costs.\n     - Manufacturing productivity headwinds, including the shutdown of certain operations in Belgium.\n     - Investments in growth, productivity, and sustainability.\n\n2. **Increased SG&A Expenses**:\n   - SG&A expenses increased by 6.1% as a percentage of net sales. This was driven by:\n     - Significant litigation costs, particularly related to Combat Arms Earplugs litigation.\n     - Impairment costs related to exiting PFAS manufacturing.\n     - Costs related to exiting Russia.\n     - Divestiture-related restructuring charges.\n     - Continued investment in key growth initiatives.\n\n3. **Gain on Business Divestitures**:\n   - A significant gain of 8.0% of net sales was recorded due to the split-off and combination of the Food Safety business with Neogen Corporation.\n\n4. **Goodwill Impairment Expense**:\n   - A goodwill impairment charge of 0.8% of net sales was recorded due to the exit from PFAS manufacturing.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe operating margin for 3M decreased from 20.8% in FY2021 to 19.1% in FY2022, a decline of 1.7%. This change was primarily driven by:\n\n- Increased costs of sales due to litigation, higher raw materials and logistics costs, and manufacturing productivity issues.\n- Higher SG&A expenses due to litigation, impairment costs, and restructuring charges.\n- A significant gain on business divestitures, which partially offset the increased expenses.\n- Goodwill impairment charges related to the exit from PFAS manufacturing.\n\nThese factors collectively contributed to the decrease in operating margin for 3M in FY2022.",

The segment with the most significant negative total sales change is the one that has had the most substantial impact on overall growth.\n\n- **Safety and Industrial Business:** -3.2%\n- **Transportation and Electronics Business:** -3.9%\n- **Health Care Business:** -2.0%\n- **Consumer Business:** -3.9%\n\nBoth the **Transportation and Electronics Business** and the **Consumer Business** have the highest negative total sales change of -3.9%. However, to determine which one has had a more significant impact, we should consider the size of each segment relative to the total sales.\n\n- Transportation and Electronics Business: 26.0% of consolidated sales\n- Consumer Business: 15.5% of consolidated sales\n\nGiven that the **Transportation and Electronics Business** constitutes a larger portion of 3M's total sales (26.0% vs. 15.5%), it has had a more substantial impact on dragging down overall growth.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nExcluding the impact of M&A, the **Transportation and Electronics Business** segment has dragged down 3M's overall growth in 2022.",

The quick ratio is calculated as follows:\n\n\\[ \\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Current Assets} - \\text{Inventory}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nFrom the provided document sections, we have the following data for Q2 of FY2023:\n\n### Current Assets:\n- Cash and cash equivalents: $4,258 million\n- Marketable securities: $56 million\n- Accounts receivable (net): $4,947 million\n- Inventories: $5,280 million (sum of finished goods, work in process, and raw materials and supplies)\n- Prepaids: $674 million\n- Other current assets: $539 million\n\nTotal current assets: $15,754 million\n\n### Current Liabilities:\n- Short-term borrowings and current portion of long-term debt: $3,033 million\n- Accounts payable: $3,231 million\n- Accrued payroll: $785 million\n- Accrued income taxes: $172 million\n- Operating lease liabilities (current): $244 million\n- Other current liabilities: $3,471 million\n\nTotal current liabilities: $10,936 million\n\n### Calculation of Quick Ratio:\n1. **Calculate Quick Assets**: Quick assets are current assets minus inventories.\n   \\[ \\text{Quick Assets} = \\text{Total Current Assets} - \\text{Inventories} \\]\n   \\[ \\text{Quick Assets} = 15,754 - 5,280 = 10,474 \\text{ million} \\]\n\n2. **Calculate Quick Ratio**:\n   \\[ \\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Quick Assets}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} \\]\n   \\[ \\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{10,474}{10,936} \\approx 0.96 \\]\n\n### Interpretation:\nThe quick ratio of 0.96 indicates that for every dollar of current liabilities, 3M has $0.96 in quick assets. A quick ratio of 1 or higher is generally considered healthy as it suggests that the company can meet its short-term obligations without relying on the sale of inventory. \n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on the quick ratio of approximately 0.96 for Q2 of FY2023, 3M has a reasonably healthy liquidity profile, though it is slightly below the ideal threshold of 1. This suggests that 3M is nearly able to cover its short-term liabilities with its most liquid assets, but it may need to rely slightly on inventory or other measures to fully meet its obligations.",

However, the consistent increase in dividend payments suggests a stable or improving payout ratio.\n\n3. **Company\u2019s Earnings and Cash Flow Statements:**\n   - The documents do not provide detailed earnings and cash flow statements. However, the consistent dividend payments and increases imply that 3M has sufficient earnings and cash flow to support these dividends.\n\n4. **Company Announcements:**\n   - 3M has a long history of paying dividends since 1916.\n   - In February 2023, 3M's Board of Directors declared a first-quarter 2023 dividend of $1.50 per share, marking the 65th consecutive year of dividend increases.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nBased on the provided information, 3M has demonstrated a stable and consistent trend of dividend distribution. The company has not only maintained but also slightly increased its dividend payments annually over the past few years. Additionally, the announcement of the 65th consecutive year of dividend increases further supports the stability and reliability of 3M's dividend distribution.\n\nTherefore, it can be concluded that 3M maintains a stable trend of dividend distribution.",

Extract the capital expenditures (Capex) for FY2017, FY2018, and FY2019.\n2. Extract the revenue for FY2017, FY2018, and FY2019.\n3. Calculate the Capex as a percentage of revenue for each year.\n4. Find the average of these percentages over the three years.\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation:\n\n#### 1. Extract Capex and Revenue Data:\nFrom the retrieved document sections, we have the following data:\n\n**Revenue:**\n- 2019: $6,489 million\n- 2018: $7,500 million\n- 2017: $7,017 million\n\n**Capex:**\n- 2019: $116 million\n- 2018: $131 million\n- 2017: $155 million\n\n#### 2. Calculate Capex as a Percentage of Revenue for Each Year:\n- **2019:** \n  \\[\n  \\text{Capex as % of Revenue} = \\left( \\frac{116}{6489} \\right) \\times 100 = 1.79\\%\n  \\]\n\n- **2018:** \n  \\[\n  \\text{Capex as % of Revenue} = \\left( \\frac{131}{7500} \\right) \\times 100 = 1.75\\%\n  \\]\n\n- **2017:** \n  \\[\n  \\text{Capex as % of Revenue} = \\left( \\frac{155}{7017} \\right) \\times 100 = 2.21\\%\n  \\]\n\n#### 3. Calculate the 3-Year Average:\n\\[\n\\text{3-Year Average} = \\frac{1.79 + 1.75 + 2.21}{3} = \\frac{5.75}{3} \\approx 1.92\\%\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe FY2017 - FY2019 3-year average of capex as a percentage of revenue for Activision Blizzard is approximately **1.9%**.",

            "answer": "To determine if Adobe has an improving operating margin profile as of FY2022, we need to analyze the operating margins over the past few fiscal years and consider any significant factors that may have impacted these margins.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Operating Margin Calculation**:\n   - Operating Margin = (Operating Income / Total Revenue) * 100\n\n2. **Operating Income and Total Revenue for FY2022, FY2021, and FY2020**:\n   - FY2022:\n     - Operating Income: $6,098 million\n     - Total Revenue: $17,606 million\n   - FY2021:\n     - Operating Income: $5,802 million\n     - Total Revenue: $15,785 million\n   - FY2020:\n     - Operating Income: $4,237 million\n     - Total Revenue: $12,868 million\n\n3. **Operating Margin Calculation**:\n   - FY2022: (6,098 / 17,606) * 100 \u2248 34.63%\n   - FY2021: (5,802 / 15,785) * 100 \u2248 36.76%\n   - FY2020: (4,237 / 12,868) * 100 \u2248 32.93%\n\n4. **Trend Analysis**:\n   - FY2020: 32.93%\n   - FY2021: 36.76%\n   - FY2022: 34.63%\n\nFrom the calculations, we observe that Adobe's operating margin increased from FY2020 to FY2021 but slightly decreased in FY2022 compared to FY2021.\n\n### Factors Impacting Operating Margin:\n- **Increased Costs**:\n  - Cost of revenue increased by 16% in FY2022.\n  - Operating expenses increased by 15% in FY2022, driven by higher compensation costs, marketing spend, and professional fees.\n- **Revenue Growth**:\n  - Total revenue increased by 12% in FY2022 compared to FY2021.\n- **Foreign Currency Impact**:\n  - Revenue was negatively impacted by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, partially offset by hedging gains.\n\n### Conclusion:\nAdobe's operating margin profile shows an improvement from FY2020 to FY2021 but a slight decline in FY2022. The decline in FY2022 can be attributed to increased costs and foreign currency impacts despite revenue growth.\n\n### Relevance of Operating Margin for Adobe:\nOperating margin is a useful metric for Adobe as it provides insight into the company's efficiency in managing its operating expenses relative to its revenue. Given Adobe's business model, which includes significant investments in research and development, sales and marketing, and the impact of subscription-based revenue, operating margin helps assess the company's profitability and operational efficiency.\n\n### Final Answer:\nAdobe's operating margin improved from FY2020 to FY2021 but slightly declined in FY2022. The operating margin remains a relevant and useful metric for evaluating Adobe's financial performance and operational efficiency.",

Average Inventory for FY2022, which can be calculated using the beginning and ending inventory values.\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation:\n\n1. **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) for FY2022:**\n   From the retrieved document sections, the total cost of sales (COGS) for FY2022 is $10,069 million.\n\n2. **Average Inventory for FY2022:**\n   - Beginning Inventory for FY2022 (as of December 31, 2021): $604 million\n   - Ending Inventory for FY2022 (as of December 31, 2022): $1,055 million\n\n   Average Inventory = (Beginning Inventory + Ending Inventory) / 2\n   \\[\n   \\text{Average Inventory} = \\frac{604 + 1055}{2} = \\frac{1659}{2} = 829.5 \\text{ million}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Inventory Turnover Ratio:**\n   Inventory Turnover Ratio = COGS / Average Inventory\n   \\[\n   \\text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{10,069}{829.5} \\approx 12.14\n   \\]\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe inventory turnover ratio for AES Corporation in FY2022 is approximately 12.14. This means that AES Corporation sold its inventory roughly 12.14 times during the fiscal year 2022.\n\n### Consideration of Conventional Inventory Management:\nAES Corporation is a utility company, and conventional inventory management may not be as meaningful for such companies compared to manufacturing or retail businesses. Utility companies typically have different operational models where inventory management does not play a central role in their business operations. Instead, their focus is more on the generation, distribution, and management of energy resources.\n\nTherefore, while the inventory turnover ratio has been calculated, it is important to note that this metric may not be as critical for AES Corporation's overall business performance and strategy.",

This indicates that AMCOR's gross margin profile is not improving; in fact, it is declining over these fiscal years.\n\n### Conclusion:\nAMCOR does not have an improving gross margin profile as of FY2023. The gross margin has been decreasing from FY2021 to FY2023. The decline in gross margin is attributed to factors such as the pass-through of higher raw material costs and the impact of disposed operations, as mentioned in the retrieved documents.",

            "answer": "To determine if AMD has a reasonably healthy liquidity profile based on its quick ratio for FY22, we need to calculate the quick ratio using the provided financial data. The quick ratio is calculated as follows:\n\n\\[ \\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Current Assets (excluding inventory)}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\nFrom the retrieved document sections, we have the following relevant information:\n\n### Current Assets (excluding inventory):\n- Cash and cash equivalents: $4,835 million\n- Short-term investments: $1,020 million\n- Accounts receivable, net: $4,126 million\n\n### Current Liabilities:\n- Total current liabilities: $6,369 million\n\nNow, let's calculate the quick ratio step by step:\n\n1. **Sum of Current Assets (excluding inventory):**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Cash and cash equivalents} + \\text{Short-term investments} + \\text{Accounts receivable, net} = 4,835 + 1,020 + 4,126 = 9,981 \\text{ million}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Current Liabilities:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total current liabilities} = 6,369 \\text{ million}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Quick Ratio Calculation:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{9,981}{6,369} \\approx 1.57\n   \\]\n\n### Interpretation:\nA quick ratio of 1.57 indicates that AMD has $1.57 in liquid assets (excluding inventory) for every $1 of current liabilities. Generally, a quick ratio greater than 1 is considered healthy as it suggests that the company can cover its short-term obligations without relying on the sale of inventory.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on the quick ratio of 1.57 for FY22, AMD appears to have a reasonably healthy liquidity profile. The quick ratio is a relevant measure of liquidity as it focuses on the most liquid assets, providing a clear picture of the company's ability to meet its short-term liabilities.",

However, the Client segment saw a decline due to weak PC market conditions.\n\n2. **Cost Increases:**\n   - The COGS increased by approximately 36%, which is less than the revenue growth rate, indicating some efficiency in production or cost management.\n   - Significant increases in R&D and SG&A expenses were noted, primarily due to strategic investments and increased headcount from acquisitions.\n\n3. **Amortization of Intangibles:**\n   - A major factor in the decreased operating margin was the amortization of intangible assets related to the Xilinx acquisition, which added $2.1 billion to operating expenses and $1.448 billion to COGS.\n\n4. **Operating Income Decline:**\n   - Despite the revenue growth, operating income decreased significantly from $3.648 billion in FY21 to $1.264 billion in FY22. This decline was primarily driven by the increased operating expenses, particularly the amortization of acquisition-related intangibles.\n\n### Calculation of Operating Margin:\n\n- **Operating Margin for FY22:**\n  \\[\n  \\text{Operating Margin} = \\frac{\\text{Operating Income}}{\\text{Revenue}} \\times 100 = \\frac{1.264 \\text{ billion}}{23.6 \\text{ billion}} \\times 100 \\approx 5.36\\%\n  \\]\n\n- **Operating Margin for FY21:**\n  \\[\n  \\text{Operating Margin} = \\frac{\\text{Operating Income}}{\\text{Revenue}} \\times 100 = \\frac{3.648 \\text{ billion}}{16.4 \\text{ billion}} \\times 100 \\approx 22.24\\%\n  \\]\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe operating margin for AMD decreased significantly from FY21 to FY22, primarily due to the increased operating expenses associated with the Xilinx acquisition, including the amortization of intangible assets. While revenue grew substantially, the costs associated with acquisitions and strategic investments in R&D and SG&A outpaced this growth, leading to a lower operating margin.\n\n### Is Operating Margin a Useful Metric for AMD?\n\nOperating margin is a useful metric for AMD as it provides insight into the company's operational efficiency and profitability before interest and taxes. However, given the significant impact of acquisitions and related amortization expenses, it is also important to consider other metrics such as EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization) to get a clearer picture of the company's core operational performance, excluding non-cash expenses related to acquisitions.",

            "answer": "To determine if American Express (AXP) has an improving operating margin profile as of 2022, we need to calculate and compare the operating margins for the years 2022, 2021, and 2020. The operating margin is calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Operating Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Operating Income}}{\\text{Total Revenues Net of Interest Expense}} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nFrom the provided document sections, we have the following data:\n\n### Total Revenues Net of Interest Expense:\n- 2022: $52,862 million\n- 2021: $42,380 million\n- 2020: $36,087 million\n\n### Total Expenses:\n- 2022: $41,095 million\n- 2021: $33,110 million\n- 2020: $27,061 million\n\n### Calculation of Operating Income:\n\\[ \\text{Operating Income} = \\text{Total Revenues Net of Interest Expense} - \\text{Total Expenses} \\]\n\n#### For 2022:\n\\[ \\text{Operating Income (2022)} = 52,862 - 41,095 = 11,767 \\text{ million} \\]\n\n#### For 2021:\n\\[ \\text{Operating Income (2021)} = 42,380 - 33,110 = 9,270 \\text{ million} \\]\n\n#### For 2020:\n\\[ \\text{Operating Income (2020)} = 36,087 - 27,061 = 9,026 \\text{ million} \\]\n\n### Calculation of Operating Margin:\n#### For 2022:\n\\[ \\text{Operating Margin (2022)} = \\left( \\frac{11,767}{52,862} \\right) \\times 100 \\approx 22.26\\% \\]\n\n#### For 2021:\n\\[ \\text{Operating Margin (2021)} = \\left( \\frac{9,270}{42,380} \\right) \\times 100 \\approx 21.88\\% \\]\n\n#### For 2020:\n\\[ \\text{Operating Margin (2020)} = \\left( \\frac{9,026}{36,087} \\right) \\times 100 \\approx 25.01\\% \\]\n\n### Analysis:\n- The operating margin for 2022 is approximately 22.26%.\n- The operating margin for 2021 is approximately 21.88%.\n- The operating margin for 2020 is approximately 25.01%.\n\nFrom this data, we can observe that the operating margin decreased from 2020 to 2021 but slightly improved from 2021 to 2022. Therefore, while there is a slight improvement in the operating margin from 2021 to 2022, the overall trend from 2020 to 2022 shows a decrease.\n\n### Suitability of Operating Margin as a Metric:\nOperating margin is a useful metric for assessing the financial health and efficiency of a company like American Express, as it indicates how well the company is managing its operating expenses relative to its revenues. However, for financial services companies, other metrics such as return on assets (ROA), return on equity (ROE), and net interest margin might also be important to consider for a comprehensive analysis.\n\n### Conclusion:\nAmerican Express (AXP) has a slightly improving operating margin profile from 2021 to 2022, but the overall trend from 2020 to 2022 shows a decrease in operating margin. Operating margin is a useful metric for assessing the company's financial health, but it should be considered alongside other financial metrics for a complete evaluation.",

            "answer": "Based on the provided document sections, it appears that gross margin is not a particularly useful metric for American Express (AXP) due to the nature of its business as a financial services company. Instead, other metrics such as net interest income, provisions for credit losses, and various categories of non-interest revenues and expenses are more indicative of the company's financial health and operational efficiency.\n\n### Key Drivers of Financial Performance for FY2022:\n\n1. **Revenue Increases:**\n   - **Discount Revenue:** Increased by 25%, primarily driven by a 23% increase in billed business.\n   - **Net Card Fees:** Increased by 24%, driven by growth in premium card portfolios.\n   - **Service Fees and Other Revenue:** Increased by 50%, driven by higher travel commissions, fees from consumer travel business, and growth in delinquency fees.\n   - **Processed Revenue:** Increased due to higher processed volumes.\n   - **Net Interest Income:** Increased by 26%, driven by higher average Card Member loan balances and interest rates.\n\n2. **Expense Increases:**\n   - **Card Member Rewards Expense:** Increased due to higher billed business and a larger proportion of spend in categories that earn incremental rewards such as travel.\n   - **Business Development Expense:** Increased due to higher partner payments driven by higher billed business.\n   - **Card Member Services Expense:** Increased due to higher usage of travel-related benefits.\n   - **Marketing Expense:** Increased due to business investments to drive growth and new card acquisitions.\n   - **Salaries and Employee Benefits:** Increased due to higher compensation costs and higher service costs.\n\n3. **Provisions for Credit Losses:**\n   - Increased due to reserve builds driven by an increase in loans outstanding, higher delinquencies, and changes in macroeconomic forecasts.\n\n### Summary:\nThe financial performance of American Express in FY2022 was driven by significant increases in various revenue streams, particularly discount revenue, net card fees, and service fees. These increases were offset by higher expenses related to card member rewards, business development, and marketing, as well as increased provisions for credit losses. The overall financial health and operational efficiency of American Express are better assessed through these metrics rather than gross margin, which is not as relevant for a financial services company.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGross margin is not a useful metric for American Express due to the nature of its business. Instead, the company's performance in FY2022 was driven by increases in discount revenue, net card fees, service fees, and net interest income, alongside higher expenses in card member rewards, business development, and marketing.",

The increase in net card fees, the growth in the number of cards-in-force, and the higher average spending per card member all point to successful retention and engagement of card members.",

            "answer": "To determine if American Water Works (AWK) has positive working capital based on FY2022 data, we need to compare the company's current assets to its current liabilities. The relevant data provided is as follows:\n\n### Current Assets (FY2022)\n- Cash and cash equivalents: $85 million\n- Restricted funds: $32 million\n- Accounts receivable, net: $334 million\n- Income tax receivable: $114 million\n- Unbilled revenues: $275 million\n- Materials and supplies: $98 million\n- Assets held for sale: $683 million\n- Other: $312 million\n- **Total current assets: $1,250 million**\n\n### Current Liabilities (FY2022)\n- Short-term debt: $1,175 million\n- Current portion of long-term debt: $281 million\n- Accounts payable: $254 million\n- Accrued liabilities: $706 million\n- Accrued taxes: $49 million\n- Accrued interest: $91 million\n- Liabilities related to assets held for sale: $83 million\n- Other: $255 million\n- **Total current liabilities: $2,811 million**\n\n### Calculation of Working Capital\nWorking capital is calculated as:\n\\[ \\text{Working Capital} = \\text{Total Current Assets} - \\text{Total Current Liabilities} \\]\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\\[ \\text{Working Capital} = \\$1,250 \\text{ million} - \\$2,811 \\text{ million} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Working Capital} = -\\$1,561 \\text{ million} \\]\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on the FY2022 data, American Water Works (AWK) has negative working capital of -$1,561 million.\n\n### Relevance of Working Capital for Utility Companies\nFor utility companies like American Water Works, working capital may not be a particularly useful or relevant metric due to the following reasons:\n\n1. **Industry Norms**: Utility companies often have significant capital expenditures and long-term debt obligations. They may rely on short-term debt to manage cash flow and fund operations, acquisitions, and construction projects.\n2. **Financial Practices**: The seasonality of the business and the nature of utility operations can lead to fluctuations in cash needs. Utility companies typically address these cash timing differences through short-term liquidity funding mechanisms.\n3. **Relevant Financial Measures**: More appropriate financial measures for utility companies include:\n   - **EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization)**: This metric provides a clearer picture of operational performance without the impact of capital structure and non-cash items.\n   - **Debt to Equity Ratio**: This ratio helps assess the company's leverage and financial stability.\n   - **Return on Equity (ROE)**: This measure indicates how effectively the company is using shareholders' equity to generate profits.\n\nGiven these industry norms and financial practices, while working capital is negative, it may not be a critical concern for American Water Works. Instead, other financial metrics should be considered to evaluate the company's financial health and performance.",

A table summarizing cash flow activities:\n   ```\n   The following table summarizes our cash flow activities (in thousands):\n   Year Ended December 31,\n   2020 2019\n   Net cash provided by operating activities $ 381,603 $ 465,699\n   ```\n\n2. A detailed explanation of the cash flow from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2020:\n   ```\n   For the year ended December 31, 2020, cash provided by operating activities was $381.6 million, primarily due to a net income of $213.1 million, offset by PPP loans facilitated, less loans sold, of $420.8 million, adjusted for the add back of non-cash expenses of $509.4 million consisting primarily of share-based compensation, transaction and loan losses, depreciation and amortization, and non-cash interest and other expenses. Whereas the increase in transaction and loan losses was largely caused by estimated losses attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic, the increase in other non-cash expenses was primarily due to the growth and expansion of our business activities. Additionally, the cash generated from operating activities increased due to a net inflow from changes in other assets and liabilities of $79.9 million due to timing.\n   ```\n\n3. Another mention of net cash provided by operating activities:\n   ```\n   Net cash provided by operating activities 381,603 465,699 295,080\n   ```\n\nFrom the information provided, it is clear that the net cash provided by operating activities for Block (formerly known as Square) in FY2020 was $381.6 million.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the query is:\n\nBlock (formerly known as Square) generated $381.6 million in cash flow from operating activities in FY2020.",

Gross margin is calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Gross Margin} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Revenue} - \\text{Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)}}{\\text{Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nWe have the following data from the retrieved documents:\n\n### Revenue and Cost of Sales Data:\n- **FY2022:**\n  - Revenue: $66,608 million\n  - Cost of Sales: $63,106 million\n\n- **FY2021:**\n  - Revenue: $62,286 million\n  - Cost of Sales: $59,269 million\n\n- **FY2020:**\n  - Revenue: $58,158 million\n  - Cost of Sales: $63,843 million\n\n### Calculation of Gross Margin:\n1. **FY2022:**\n   \\[ \\text{Gross Margin} = \\left( \\frac{66,608 - 63,106}{66,608} \\right) \\times 100 = \\left( \\frac{3,502}{66,608} \\right) \\times 100 \\approx 5.26\\% \\]\n\n2. **FY2021:**\n   \\[ \\text{Gross Margin} = \\left( \\frac{62,286 - 59,269}{62,286} \\right) \\times 100 = \\left( \\frac{3,017}{62,286} \\right) \\times 100 \\approx 4.84\\% \\]\n\n3. **FY2020:**\n   \\[ \\text{Gross Margin} = \\left( \\frac{58,158 - 63,843}{58,158} \\right) \\times 100 = \\left( \\frac{-5,685}{58,158} \\right) \\times 100 \\approx -9.77\\% \\]\n\n### Analysis:\n- **FY2020:** Gross Margin was approximately -9.77%, indicating a negative margin due to higher COGS than revenue.\n- **FY2021:** Gross Margin improved to approximately 4.84%.\n- **FY2022:** Gross Margin further improved to approximately 5.26%.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBoeing's gross margin profile has shown improvement from FY2020 to FY2022. The gross margin went from a negative value in FY2020 to positive values in FY2021 and FY2022, with a slight increase from 4.84% in FY2021 to 5.26% in FY2022.\n\n### Consideration of Gross Margin as a Useful Metric:\nWhile gross margin provides insight into the relationship between revenue and direct costs, it may not be the most insightful metric for a company like Boeing due to the following reasons:\n\n1. **Aerospace and Defense Industry Characteristics:**\n   - The industry is characterized by long-term contracts, significant R&D investments, and high fixed costs, which can distort gross margin analysis.\n   - Program accounting and long-term contract accounting can lead to fluctuations in reported costs and revenues that do not reflect the underlying economic performance.\n\n2. **Extraordinary Items and Restructuring Costs:**\n   - Boeing has faced significant extraordinary items, such as charges related to the 737 MAX grounding, COVID-19 impacts, and restructuring costs, which can significantly affect gross margins.\n\n3. **Other Relevant Financial Metrics:**\n   - Operating margins, net income, and cash flow from operations may provide a more comprehensive view of Boeing's financial health.\n   - Segment-specific performance metrics, such as earnings from operations and operating margins for Commercial Airplanes (BCA), Defense, Space & Security (BDS), and Global Services (BGS), are also critical.\n\nGiven these considerations, while Boeing's gross margin has improved, it is essential to look at a broader set of financial metrics to get a complete picture of the company's performance.",

            "answer": "To determine if Boeing's business is subject to cyclicality, we need to analyze the provided document sections for relevant information on historical financial performance, key business segments, industry and market conditions, economic cycles, and management discussions.\n\n1. **Market Conditions and Demand Drivers**:\n   - The commercial aircraft market is significantly influenced by long-term trends in airline passenger and cargo traffic, which are driven by sustained economic growth and political stability. Other factors include airline profitability, aircraft financing availability, world trade policies, government relations, technological advances, fuel prices, terrorism, pandemics, and environmental regulations.\n   - Historically, the airline industry has been cyclical and very competitive, experiencing significant profit swings and constant challenges to be more cost-competitive. Economic downturns or instability in the airline industry can lead to fewer new orders for aircraft or services, postponements, or cancellations, affecting Boeing's revenues, profitability, and cash flows.\n\n2. **Impact of Economic and Industry Cycles**:\n   - The document mentions that the airline industry is cyclical and has experienced significant profit swings. This cyclicality is tied to broader economic conditions and specific industry challenges.\n   - The COVID-19 pandemic had a substantial impact on the airline industry, leading to reduced demand and production disruptions. The recovery from the pandemic is ongoing, with varying impacts globally.\n\n3. **Financial Performance and Segment Analysis**:\n   - Boeing's financial performance has shown variability, with revenues increasing in 2022 compared to 2021, driven by higher revenues in the Commercial Airplanes (BCA) and Global Services (BGS) segments, but offset by lower revenues in Defense, Space & Security (BDS).\n   - The company has experienced losses from operations in recent years, with significant losses in the Commercial Airplanes segment due to production issues and the impact of the pandemic.\n   - The Defense, Space & Security segment has also faced challenges, with losses in 2022 due to charges on development programs and unfavorable performance across other defense programs.\n\n4. **Management Discussion and Analysis**:\n   - The management discussion highlights the impact of macroeconomic, industry, and customer factors on Boeing's performance. The company acknowledges the cyclical nature of the airline industry and the associated risks.\n   - The long-term outlook for the industry remains positive, driven by economic growth and increasing air travel demand. However, the industry remains vulnerable to external shocks such as fuel price spikes, credit market shocks, terrorism, natural disasters, conflicts, epidemics, and pandemics.\n\nBased on the provided information, it is clear that Boeing's business is subject to cyclicality. The company's performance is closely tied to the broader economic environment and specific industry conditions, which can lead to significant variability in demand, revenues, and profitability over time. The historical financial performance and management discussions further support the conclusion that Boeing's business experiences cyclical trends.",

            "answer": "To determine if Corning (GLW) has positive working capital based on FY2022 data, we need to look at the total current assets and total current liabilities for the fiscal year 2022. Working capital is calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Working Capital} = \\text{Total Current Assets} - \\text{Total Current Liabilities} \\]\n\nFrom the retrieved document sections, we have the following relevant information:\n\n- Working capital for December 31, 2022: $2,278 million\n- Working capital for December 31, 2021: $2,853 million\n- Current ratio for December 31, 2022: 1.4:1\n- Current ratio for December 31, 2021: 1.6:1\n\nThe working capital value provided directly indicates that Corning has positive working capital for FY2022. Specifically, the working capital for December 31, 2022, is $2,278 million, which is a positive value.\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Working Capital**: This is a measure of a company's short-term financial health and its efficiency. Positive working capital indicates that a company can cover its short-term liabilities with its short-term assets.\n- **Current Ratio**: This is another measure of liquidity, calculated as current assets divided by current liabilities. A current ratio above 1 indicates that the company has more current assets than current liabilities, which is a good sign of liquidity.\n\nGiven the working capital of $2,278 million and a current ratio of 1.4:1 for FY2022, it is clear that Corning has positive working capital and is in a good position to cover its short-term liabilities with its short-term assets.\n\n### Conclusion:\nYes, Corning has positive working capital based on FY2022 data. The working capital for December 31, 2022, is $2,278 million, indicating that the company is in a healthy financial position in terms of liquidity.",

            "answer": "To determine if CVS Health is a capital-intensive business based on FY2022 data, we need to analyze the following key financial metrics:\n\n1. **Total capital expenditures (CapEx) for FY2022**: $2.7 billion\n2. **Total revenue for FY2022**: $322.467 billion\n3. **Total assets for FY2022**: This information is not provided in the retrieved documents.\n4. **Depreciation and amortization expenses for FY2022**: $4.247 billion\n5. **Industry benchmarks for capital intensity**: This information is not provided in the retrieved documents.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Calculate CapEx as a percentage of total revenue**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{CapEx as a percentage of revenue} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{CapEx}}{\\text{Total Revenue}} \\right) \\times 100\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{CapEx as a percentage of revenue} = \\left( \\frac{2.7 \\text{ billion}}{322.467 \\text{ billion}} \\right) \\times 100 \\approx 0.84\\%\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate CapEx as a percentage of total assets**:\n   Since the total assets for FY2022 are not provided in the retrieved documents, we cannot calculate this metric.\n\n3. **Compare CapEx to depreciation and amortization**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{CapEx} = 2.7 \\text{ billion}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Depreciation and amortization} = 4.247 \\text{ billion}\n   \\]\n   The CapEx is lower than the depreciation and amortization expenses, which might indicate that CVS Health is not heavily investing in new capital assets relative to the wear and tear of existing assets.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on the available data, CVS Health's capital expenditures as a percentage of revenue for FY2022 is approximately 0.84%. Without the total assets and industry benchmarks, it is challenging to definitively conclude whether CVS Health is a capital-intensive business. However, the relatively low CapEx as a percentage of revenue and the fact that CapEx is lower than depreciation and amortization expenses suggest that CVS Health may not be highly capital-intensive.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided information, CVS Health does not appear to be a capital-intensive business for FY2022.",

Some notable legal dispute areas for CVS are: (1) usual and customary pricing litigation: where it's claimed that CVS\u2019s retail pharmacies overcharged for prescription drugs; (2) PBM litigation and investigations: where it's claimed that that rebate agreements between the drug manufacturers and PBMs caused inflated prices for certain drug products; and (3) controlled substances litigation: legal matters around opioids for which CVS has agreed to pay up to $4.3 billion to claimants in remediation and $625 million to attorneys and fees",

            "answer": "To answer the query about whether any board member nominees had substantially more votes against joining than the other nominees, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Voting Results**: We need the voting results for each board member nominee from the most recent shareholder meeting. This includes the number of votes for and against each nominee.\n\n2. **Define \"Substantially More Votes Against\"**: We need to establish a criterion for what constitutes \"substantially more votes against.\" This could be a percentage difference or a specific threshold of votes.\n\n3. **Compare the Votes**: Using the defined criteria, we compare the votes against each nominee to determine if any nominee had substantially more votes against them compared to others.\n\nSince the retrieved document sections are not provided in the query, I will outline the process assuming we have the necessary data:\n\n### Step-by-Step Process:\n\n1. **Retrieve Voting Data**:\n   - Obtain the voting results for each board member nominee from the most recent proxy statement or SEC Form DEF 14A for Foot Locker, Inc. (FL).\n\n2. **Establish Comparison Criteria**:\n   - Define what \"substantially more votes against\" means. For example, we might consider a nominee to have substantially more votes against if they received 10% more votes against than the average of the other nominees.\n\n3. **Calculate and Compare**:\n   - Calculate the average number of votes against for all nominees.\n   - Compare each nominee's votes against this average to see if any nominee exceeds the threshold.\n\n### Example Calculation (Hypothetical Data):\n\nAssume we have the following voting results for five nominees:\n\n| Nominee | Votes For | Votes Against |\n|---------|-----------|---------------|\n| A       | 10,000    | 500           |\n| B       | 9,800     | 700           |\n| C       | 9,900     | 600           |\n| D       | 10,100    | 400           |\n| E       | 9,950     | 650           |\n\n1. **Calculate the Average Votes Against**:\n   - Total votes against = 500 + 700 + 600 + 400 + 650 = 2,850\n   - Average votes against = 2,850 / 5 = 570\n\n2. **Determine the Threshold**:\n   - If we consider \"substantially more\" to be 10% more than the average:\n   - Threshold = 570 + (10% of 570) = 570 + 57 = 627\n\n3. **Compare Each Nominee**:\n   - Nominee A: 500 votes against (below threshold)\n   - Nominee B: 700 votes against (above threshold)\n   - Nominee C: 600 votes against (below threshold)\n   - Nominee D: 400 votes against (below threshold)\n   - Nominee E: 650 votes against (above threshold)\n\nIn this hypothetical example, Nominees B and E have substantially more votes against them compared to the threshold.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nBased on the hypothetical data and the defined criteria, Nominees B and E had substantially more votes against them compared to the other nominees. \n\nHowever, since the actual voting data from the most recent proxy statement or SEC Form DEF 14A for Foot Locker, Inc. (FL) is not provided in the query, I cannot give a definitive answer. Please provide the specific voting results data to perform an accurate analysis.",

The growth rates are modest, and there are declines in net income and EPS, which are critical indicators of financial health and growth potential.",

Factors Affecting Gross Margin\n- **Cost Increases**: \n  - One-time COVID-19 vaccine manufacturing exit related costs.\n  - Currency impacts in the Pharmaceutical segment.\n  - Commodity inflation in the MedTech and Consumer Health segments.\n- **Cost Reductions**:\n  - Supply chain benefits in the Consumer Health segment.\n\n### 6. Market Conditions\n- **Currency Fluctuations**: Negative impact on sales due to currency exchange rates.\n- **Commodity Inflation**: Increased costs in raw materials and production.\n\n### 7. Operational Changes\n- **Cost Reduction Programs**: Efforts to maintain profit margins through cost reduction programs and productivity improvements.\n\n### Calculation of Gross Margin Change\n- **Gross Margin Change**: \n  - FY2021: 68.2%\n  - FY2022: 67.3%\n  - Change = 67.3% - 68.2% = -0.9%\n\n### Conclusion\nThe gross margin for Johnson & Johnson decreased from 68.2% in FY2021 to 67.3% in FY2022, a decline of 0.9 percentage points. This change was primarily driven by:\n- Increased costs due to one-time COVID-19 vaccine manufacturing exit related costs.\n- Negative currency impacts in the Pharmaceutical segment.\n- Commodity inflation in the MedTech and Consumer Health segments.\n- These cost increases were partially offset by supply chain benefits in the Consumer Health segment.\n\nTherefore, the gross margin is a useful metric for Johnson & Johnson as it provides insight into how well the company manages its production costs relative to its sales across various segments. The detailed breakdown of costs and segment performance helps in understanding the specific factors that influenced the gross margin change.",

            "answer": "To determine if growth in J&J's adjusted EPS is expected to accelerate in FY2023, we need to analyze the following pieces of information:\n\n1. Historical adjusted EPS data for J&J.\n2. Adjusted EPS guidance or estimates for FY2023 provided by J&J.\n3. Analysts' consensus adjusted EPS forecasts for FY2023.\n4. Any recent company announcements or market analyses concerning J&J's earnings performance and growth outlook.\n\nLet's go through the information step by step:\n\n1. **Historical Adjusted EPS Data**:\n   - We need the adjusted EPS figures for the past few years to establish a trend. For example, if J&J's adjusted EPS was $8.00 in FY2021 and $8.50 in FY2022, we can calculate the growth rate.\n\n2. **Adjusted EPS Guidance or Estimates for FY2023**:\n   - J&J might provide their own guidance for FY2023. For instance, if they project an adjusted EPS of $9.00 for FY2023, this would be crucial for our analysis.\n\n3. **Analysts' Consensus Adjusted EPS Forecasts for FY2023**:\n   - Analysts' forecasts can provide an external perspective on expected growth. If the consensus forecast is also $9.00, it would support the company's guidance.\n\n4. **Recent Company Announcements or Market Analyses**:\n   - Any recent updates or analyses can provide context or adjustments to the expected EPS growth.\n\n### Example Calculation:\nAssume the following data:\n- Adjusted EPS for FY2021: $8.00\n- Adjusted EPS for FY2022: $8.50\n- Adjusted EPS guidance for FY2023: $9.00\n\n#### Step-by-Step Calculation:\n1. **Calculate the growth rate from FY2021 to FY2022**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Growth Rate} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{EPS in FY2022} - \\text{EPS in FY2021}}{\\text{EPS in FY2021}} \\right) \\times 100\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Growth Rate} = \\left( \\frac{8.50 - 8.00}{8.00} \\right) \\times 100 = 6.25\\%\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the growth rate from FY2022 to FY2023**:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Growth Rate} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{EPS in FY2023} - \\text{EPS in FY2022}}{\\text{EPS in FY2022}} \\right) \\times 100\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Growth Rate} = \\left( \\frac{9.00 - 8.50}{8.50} \\right) \\times 100 = 5.88\\%\n   \\]\n\n### Analysis:\n- The growth rate from FY2021 to FY2022 is 6.25%.\n- The growth rate from FY2022 to FY2023 is 5.88%.\n\nBased on this example, the growth rate in adjusted EPS is not accelerating; it is slightly decelerating from 6.25% to 5.88%.\n\n### Conclusion:\nIf the provided data and calculations are accurate, the growth in J&J's adjusted EPS is not expected to accelerate in FY2023. Instead, it shows a slight deceleration.\n\nHowever, if the retrieved document sections do not provide sufficient information to perform these calculations or if the necessary data points are missing, the answer would be:\n\n**Information could not be found in the database.**\n\nPlease provide the specific data points or additional context if available to refine the analysis.",

            "answer": "Gross margin is typically a key metric for manufacturing and retail companies as it measures the difference between revenue and the cost of goods sold. For financial services companies like JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM), gross margin is not a particularly relevant metric. Instead, financial institutions are generally evaluated based on other metrics such as net interest margin, return on assets (ROA), return on equity (ROE), efficiency ratio, and various capital adequacy metrics.\n\nThis is primarily because financial institutions operate differently compared to manufacturing or retail businesses. Their main sources of revenue include interest income, fees, and trading revenues, among others, and their costs include interest expenses, loan losses, and operating expenses. Due to the nature of these income and expense categories, gross margin is not commonly used as a performance metric in the financial services industry.\n\nFor a thorough analysis, investors and analysts often look at other specific financial ratios and performance indicators that provide more insights into a bank\u2019s profitability, efficiency, and financial health.\n\nIf you need specific historical data or detailed financial analysis, we can refer to JPMorgan Chase's SEC filings like the 10-K and 10-Q reports, which provide comprehensive financial information and performance metrics relevant to the banking sector.",

Inventory at the end of FY2019 from the balance sheet.\n\nFrom the retrieved document sections, we have the following data:\n\n1. **FY2019 COGS**: The document provides three figures for the cost of products sold: 16,830, 17,347, and 17,043. Since we are interested in FY2019, we will use the first figure, which is $16,830 million.\n\n2. **Inventory at the end of FY2018**: The inventory at the end of FY2018 is $2,667 million.\n\n3. **Inventory at the end of FY2019**: The inventory at the end of FY2019 is $2,721 million.\n\nNext, we calculate the average inventory for FY2019:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Average Inventory} = \\frac{\\text{Inventory at the end of FY2018} + \\text{Inventory at the end of FY2019}}{2}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{Average Inventory} = \\frac{2,667 + 2,721}{2} = \\frac{5,388}{2} = 2,694 \\text{ million}\n\\]\n\nNow, we can calculate the inventory turnover ratio using the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{FY2019 COGS}}{\\text{Average Inventory}}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{Inventory Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{16,830}{2,694} \\approx 6.25\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Kraft Heinz's FY2019 inventory turnover ratio is approximately **6.25**.",

            "answer": "To determine MGM's interest coverage ratio for the fiscal year 2022 using Adjusted EBIT as the numerator and annual Interest Expense as the denominator, we need the following information:\n\n1. MGM's Adjusted Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT) for the fiscal year 2022.\n2. MGM's annual Interest Expense for the fiscal year 2022.\n\nFrom the retrieved document sections, we have the following relevant information:\n\n### Adjusted EBIT for FY2022:\nThe document provides Adjusted EBITDAR (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, Amortization, and Rent) for FY2022, but not directly Adjusted EBIT. However, we can derive Adjusted EBIT from the provided data.\n\nAdjusted EBITDAR for FY2022: $3,497,254,000\n\nTo convert Adjusted EBITDAR to Adjusted EBIT, we need to subtract Depreciation, Amortization, and Rent expenses:\n\n- Depreciation and Amortization for FY2022: $3,482,050,000\n- Triple-net operating lease and ground lease rent expense for FY2022: $1,950,566,000\n\nAdjusted EBIT = Adjusted EBITDAR - Depreciation and Amortization - Rent Expense\nAdjusted EBIT = $3,497,254,000 - $3,482,050,000 - $1,950,566,000\nAdjusted EBIT = $3,497,254,000 - $5,432,616,000\nAdjusted EBIT = -$1,935,362,000 (This indicates a negative Adjusted EBIT, which is unusual and might suggest an error in the provided data or a need for further adjustments.)\n\n### Annual Interest Expense for FY2022:\nThe document provides the annual interest expense for FY2022:\n\nInterest Expense for FY2022: $594,954,000\n\n### Calculation of Interest Coverage Ratio:\nInterest Coverage Ratio = Adjusted EBIT / Interest Expense\n\nGiven the negative Adjusted EBIT, the interest coverage ratio would also be negative, which is not typical for a healthy company. This suggests that MGM's Adjusted EBIT was insufficient to cover its interest expenses in FY2022.\n\nInterest Coverage Ratio = -$1,935,362,000 / $594,954,000\nInterest Coverage Ratio \u2248 -3.25\n\n### Conclusion:\nMGM's interest coverage ratio for FY2022, using Adjusted EBIT as the numerator and annual Interest Expense as the denominator, is approximately -3.25. This negative ratio indicates that MGM's Adjusted EBIT was not sufficient to cover its interest expenses for the year.",

The document mentions that approximately $700 million in costs are expected, with about 90% of these costs already incurred by the end of Q2'2023. This indicates that the separation process is well underway.\n\n2. **Divestiture of Early-Stage Rare Disease Gene Therapy Portfolio**: In July 2023, Pfizer entered into an agreement with Alexion, a subsidiary of AstraZeneca plc, to sell and license its early-stage rare disease gene therapy portfolio. The total consideration for this transaction could be up to $1 billion, plus tiered royalties. This transaction is expected to close in Q3'2023.\n\nFrom this information, it is clear that Pfizer is involved in significant business segment changes as of Q2'2023. Specifically, they are separating the Upjohn business and divesting their early-stage rare disease gene therapy portfolio.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the query is:\n\nYes, as of Q2'2023, Pfizer is spinning off its Upjohn business segment and divesting its early-stage rare disease gene therapy portfolio.",

            "answer": "To answer the query about what drove the increase in Ulta Beauty's merchandise inventories balance at the end of FY2023, let's analyze the relevant information provided in the retrieved document sections.\n\nThe document states that merchandise inventories, net were $1.6 billion at January 28, 2023, compared to $1.5 billion at January 29, 2022. This represents an increase of $104.2 million or 7.0%. The document further breaks down the reasons for this increase as follows:\n\n1. **$54 million increase due to the addition of 47 new stores opened since January 29, 2022**: This indicates that a significant portion of the inventory increase is attributed to the expansion of Ulta Beauty's retail footprint with the opening of new stores.\n\n2. **$25 million increase due to new key brand launches**: This suggests that the introduction of new brands into Ulta Beauty's product lineup contributed to the higher inventory levels.\n\n3. **$25 million increase primarily due to inventory cost increases**: This implies that rising costs associated with inventory, possibly due to inflation or higher supplier prices, also played a role in the increased inventory balance.\n\nBased on this information, the primary drivers for the increase in Ulta Beauty's merchandise inventories balance at the end of FY2023 are:\n\n- The addition of 47 new stores, which required stocking new inventory.\n- The launch of new key brands, necessitating additional inventory.\n- Increases in inventory costs.\n\nThese factors collectively contributed to the $104.2 million increase in merchandise inventories.\n\nTherefore, the increase in Ulta Beauty's merchandise inventories balance at the end of FY2023 was driven by store expansion, new brand launches, and higher inventory costs.",

            "answer": "To assess Verizon's liquidity profile based on its quick ratio for FY 2022, we need to calculate the quick ratio using the provided financial information. The quick ratio is calculated as follows:\n\n\\[ \\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Current Assets (excluding inventory)}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}} \\]\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation:\n\n1. **Current Assets (excluding inventory):**\n   - Cash and Cash Equivalents: $2.6 billion\n   - Accounts Receivable (net): $24.506 billion\n\n   Total Current Assets (excluding inventory) = $2.6 billion + $24.506 billion = $27.106 billion\n\n2. **Current Liabilities:**\n   - Debt maturing within one year: $9.963 billion\n   - Accounts payable and accrued liabilities: $23.977 billion\n   - Current operating lease liabilities: $4.134 billion\n   - Other current liabilities: $12.097 billion\n\n   Total Current Liabilities = $9.963 billion + $23.977 billion + $4.134 billion + $12.097 billion = $50.171 billion\n\n3. **Quick Ratio Calculation:**\n\n\\[ \\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{\\$27.106 \\text{ billion}}{\\$50.171 \\text{ billion}} \\approx 0.54 \\]\n\n### Interpretation:\n\nA quick ratio of 0.54 indicates that Verizon has $0.54 in liquid assets for every $1 of current liabilities. This is generally considered below the ideal quick ratio of 1.0, which suggests that the company may not have sufficient liquid assets to cover its short-term liabilities without relying on the sale of inventory or additional financing.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nBased on the quick ratio of 0.54 for FY 2022, Verizon does not appear to have a reasonably healthy liquidity profile. The quick ratio is a relevant measure for assessing liquidity as it focuses on the company's ability to meet short-term obligations with its most liquid assets. However, it is also important to consider other metrics such as the current ratio, cash flow analysis, and the company's ability to access capital markets for a comprehensive assessment of liquidity.",

However, we can still analyze the provided data to determine if Verizon is capital-intensive.\n\n### Analysis\n\n**Capital Intensity Ratio**:\nThe capital intensity ratio is calculated as the ratio of capital expenditures to total revenue.

Extracting the Required Data:\n\n**Operating Income:**\n- FY2020: $20,568 million\n- FY2019: $21,957 million\n- FY2018: $20,437 million\n\n**Depreciation and Amortization:**\n- FY2020: $10,987 million\n- FY2019: $10,678 million\n- FY2018: $10,529 million\n\n**Total Revenue:**\n- FY2020: $523,964 million\n- FY2019: $514,405 million\n- FY2018: $500,343 million\n\n#### 2. Calculating Unadjusted EBITDA:\n\n**Unadjusted EBITDA = Operating Income + Depreciation and Amortization**\n\n- FY2020: $20,568 million + $10,987 million = $31,555 million\n- FY2019: $21,957 million + $10,678 million = $32,635 million\n- FY2018: $20,437 million + $10,529 million = $30,966 million\n\n#### 3. Calculating Unadjusted EBITDA % Margin:\n\n**Unadjusted EBITDA % Margin = (Unadjusted EBITDA / Total Revenue) * 100**\n\n- FY2020: ($31,555 million / $523,964 million) * 100 \u2248 6.0%\n- FY2019: ($32,635 million / $514,405 million) * 100 \u2248 6.3%\n- FY2018: ($30,966 million / $500,343 million) * 100 \u2248 6.2%\n\n#### 4.
